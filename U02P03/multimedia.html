              The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists,
              against each other in different objective-based game modes. The
              most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb
              while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or
              Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the
              Terrorists have captured. There are eight official game modes, all
              of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The
              game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on
              dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers
              with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode,
              "Danger Zone", was introduced in December 2018.
